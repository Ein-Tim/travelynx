travelynx - Railway Travel Logger
---

[travelynx](https://finalrewind.org/projects/travelynx/) allows checking into
individual public transit vehicles (e.g. buses, ferries, trams, trains) across
most of Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Luxembourg, Ireland, Denmark, and parts
of the USA. Thus, it provides a log of your railway journeys annotated with
real-time delays and service messages, if available. It supports German
long-distance, regional and local transit exposed by the Deutsche Bahn [bahn.de
interface](https://finalrewind.org/projects/Travel-Status-DE-DBRIS/), a variety
of [EFA](https://finalrewind.org/projects/Travel-Status-DE-VRR/) and
[HAFAS](https://finalrewind.org/projects/Travel-Status-DE-HAFAS/) interfaces,
andt [MOTIS](https://finalrewind.org/projects/Travel-Status-MOTIS/) APIs
including the [transitous](https://transitous.org/) aggregator.

You can use the public instance on [travelynx.de](https://travelynx.de) or
host your own. Further reading:

## Testing

The test scripts assume that travelynx.conf contains a valid database
connection. They will create a test-specific schema, perform all operations in
it, and then drop the schema. As such, the database specified in the config is
not affected.

Nevertheless, bugs may happen. Do NOT run tests on your production database.
Please use a separate development database instead.

Run the tests by executing `prove`. Use `prove -v` for debug output and
`DBI_TRACE=SQL prove -v` to monitor SQL queries.
